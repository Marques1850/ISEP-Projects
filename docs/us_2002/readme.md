# US G002


## 1. Context

*We are starting the implementation form scratch*

## 2. Requirements
**US 2002**As Student, I want to view a list of my future exams
*Regarding this requirement we understand it depends on the course creation on US 1002 and exame creation on US 2001.*


## 3. Analysis

### Domain Model ###

### Use Case Diagram ###

### System Sequence Diagrams ###

## 4. Design

*In this sections, the team should present the solution design that was adopted to solve the requirement. This should include, at least, a diagram of the realization of the functionality (e.g., sequence diagram), a class diagram (presenting the classes that support the functionality), the identification and rational behind the applied design patterns and the specification of the main tests used to validade the functionality.*

### 4.1. Realization

### 4.2. Class Diagram

### Sequence Diagram ###

### 4.3. Applied Patterns

### 4.4. Tests

**Test 1:** *Verifies that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.*

```
@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
	Example instance = new Example(null, null);
}
````

## 5. Implementation

*In this section the team should present, if necessary, some evidencies that the implementation is according to the design. It should also describe and explain other important artifacts necessary to fully understand the implementation like, for instance, configuration files.*

*It is also a best practice to include a listing (with a brief summary) of the major commits regarding this requirement.*

## 6. Integration/Demonstration

*In this section the team should describe the efforts realized in order to integrate this functionality with the other parts/components of the system*

*It is also important to explain any scripts or instructions required to execute an demonstrate this functionality*

## 7. Observations

*This section should be used to include any content that does not fit any of the previous sections.*

*The team should present here, for instance, a critical prespective on the developed work including the analysis of alternative solutioons or related works*

*The team should include in this section statements/references regarding third party works that were used in the development this work.*
