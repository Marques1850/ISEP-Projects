# Project eCourse

## 1. Description of the Project

learning. For the moment the goal is to develop, in an exploratory way, a new remote learning platform called eCourse, 
using a minimum viable product (MVP) approach.*

*The results of this exploratory development will be of high value and the basis for
how the company will evaluate the viability of the project as a possible commercial solution.*
